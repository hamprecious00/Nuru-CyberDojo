        <h2>What does computer repair mean?</h2>
        <p>
            Computer repair is the process of identifying, troubleshooting and resolving problems and issues in a faulty computer. Computer repair is a broad field encompassing many tools, techniques and procedures used to repair computer hardware, software or network/Internet problems.
        </p>
        <h3>Summary of computer repair</h3>
        <p>
            Computer repair is handled by a specialized computer repair technician. Typically, a hardware fault requires the physical review of a computer and testing for abnormalities. Suspected components, such as random access memory (RAM), hard disk, power supply or optical drive may be individually checked, troubleshooted or replaced if an error is detected. This usually requires special equipment and accessories to disassemble and reassemble the computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software-based computer repair issues are generally related to operating system (OS) configuration or updates, installed applications, viruses and other software services. Similarly, computer repair for network/Internet issues allow a computer to completely utilize available and network services.

        <h1>What is RAM?</h1>
        <P>
        RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. RAM is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive.

        Random Access Memory is volatile. That means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on, but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.
       </P>
       <h2>How it works</h2>
       <p>
       The term random access as applied to RAM comes from the fact that any storage location, also known as any memory address, can be accessed directly. Originally, the term Random Access Memory was used to distinguish regular core memory from offline memory.
       </p>
       <p>
       Offline memory typically referred to magnetic tape from which a specific piece of data could only be accessed by locating the address sequentially, starting at the beginning of the tape. RAM is organized and controlled in a way that enables data to be stored and retrieved directly to and from specific locations.
       </p>
       <p>
        RAM is similar in concept to a set of boxes in which each box can hold a 0 or a 1. Each box has a unique address that is found by counting across the columns and down the rows. A set of RAM boxes is called an array, and each box is known as a cell.
       </p>
       <p>
       To find a specific cell, the RAM controller sends the column and row address down a thin electrical line etched into the chip. Each row and column in a RAM array has its own address line. Any data that's read flows back on a separate data line.
       </p>
       <p> 
       RAM is physically small and stored in microchips. It's also small in terms of the amount of data it can hold. A typical laptop computer may come with 8 gigabytes of RAM, while a hard disk can hold 10 terabytes.
       </p>
       <p>
       Most PCs enable users to add RAM modules up to a certain limit. Having more RAM in a computer cuts down on the number of times the processor must read data from the hard disk, an operation that takes longer than reading data from RAM. RAM access time is in nanoseconds, while storage memory access time is in milliseconds.
       </p>
       <h3>How much RAM do you need</h3>
       <p>
       The amount of RAM needed all depends on what the user is doing. When video editing, for example, it's recommended that a system have at least 16 GB RAM, though more is desirable. For photo editing using Photoshop, Adobe recommends a system have at least 3GB of RAM to run Photoshop CC on a Mac. However, if the user is working with other applications at the same time, even 8GB of RAM can slow things down.
       </p>

        <h1>How to Install Windows</h1>
        <p>
            Each version of Microsoft Windows is installed on a computer using similar steps. While there are steps in the installation process that differ between versions of Windows, the following general steps and guidelines help you install Windows on your computer.
        </p>
        <h2>Installing or upgrading Windows</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
               <p>Open the CMOS setup.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
              Change the computer's boot order. Set the CD, DVD, or disc drive as the first boot device if you are trying to boot from a disc. Or, set the first boot device to your USB drive if you're trying to boot from a USB thumb drive. If the drive is not shown, keep the disc is inserted and reboot the computer. With the disc in the drive, BIOS (basic input/output system) should recognize and include it in the list.
              </p>
            </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                 Save the settings change and exit BIOS.
                 Once you have updated the boot order, you can begin the Windows installation process.
                </p>
              </li>
                <li>
               <p>
              Place the Windows disc in the CD/DVD drive or USB thumb drive into the back of the computer.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              Turn on or restart the computer. As the computer starts up, it should detect the installation disc or drive and show a message similar to Press any key to boot from CD. Press any key on the keyboard to have the computer boot from the Windows disc or drive.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              After the Windows install begins, there are several prompts that you need to answer. Select either Yes or the appropriate option to install Windows.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              When asked which partition to install Windows onto, select the main partition, usually the C: drive or one labeled "Unallocated partition". If upgrading Windows, select the existing installation of Windows on the hard drive.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              You may be asked if you want to erase all contents on the hard drive, then install Windows. We recommend you choose this option, as it also formats the hard drive to allow the Windows operating system to be installed.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              The computer may need to restart several times during the Windows install process. The restarts are normal and if prompted to restart, select the Yes option.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              When the install process is nearly complete, the Windows configuration option screens are shown. On these screens, you may be asked to select the time zone you live in, your preferred language, and the account's name you use to access Windows. Select the appropriate options and enter the appropriate information on each configuration screen.
          </p>
      </li>
