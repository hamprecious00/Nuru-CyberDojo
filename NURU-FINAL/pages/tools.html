        <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
        <p>
            Cyber Security is the practice of securing the organizations data or information from the cyber criminals. As the world is getting adopted to modern world, attackers are not following the traditional or old way of stealing data from the users. They are getting adopted to new technologies and tools that can be used to steal the data through digital medium. Cyber Security is like a cat and mice play where cyber attackers will try to penetrate the network and attack, while cyber defenders will block or stop the attackers from accessing their data. However, these fights are not in physical mode, they use various best cyber security tools for attacking and defending. The same tool can be used in both positive and negative mode. It is all in the mindset and motive of the person who is using the tool.
        </p>
        <h3>Summary of cyber security</h3>
        <p>
           As this cyber security field is getting enormous along with emerging tools. There are a lot of open-source tools available in the cyber market for several reasons. Cyber security practice is a crime if you are performing the activity without the company’s knowledge or the concern person’s knowledge. It is necessary to ensure all the security guidelines are read carefully. Nowadays cyber security domain is paving way for most IT people to make cyber security a primary domain in their professional life which will not only help the candidate to grow professionally but also personally. You can do cyber security certifications and gain relevant knowledge on this field.
