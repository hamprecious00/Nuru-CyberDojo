	<h1>What is Network Monitoring?</h1>
	<p>
		In today's world, the term network monitoring is widespread throughout the IT industry. Network monitoring is a critical IT process where all networking components like routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and VMs are monitored for fault and performance and evaluated continuously to maintain and optimize their availability. One important aspect of network monitoring is that it should be proactive. Finding performance issues and bottlenecks proactively helps in identifying issues at the initial stage. Efficient proactive server monitoring can prevent network downtime or failures. 
	</p>
	<h2>How to perform network monitoring effectively</h2>
	<p>
		For an efficient network monitoring, you need to cut-off the unnecessary load to the network monitor, at every step possible by:
		<ol>
			<li>Monitoring only the essentials</li>
			<li>Optimizing the monitoring interval</li>
			<li>Choosing the right protocol</li>
			<li>Setting thresholds</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Setting up monitoring thresholds</h3>
	<p> 
		Network downtime can cost a lot of money. In most cases, the end-user reports a network issue to the network monitoring team. The reason behind this is a poor approach to a proactive enterprise network monitor. The key challenge in real time network monitoring is to identify performance bottlenecks proactively. This is where thresholds play a major role in network monitoring application. Threshold limits vary from device to device based on the business use case.

	<h1>Security compliance tools. ...</h1>
	<p> 
	Security compliance software helps companies document their compliance with cyber security frameworks in order to pass security audits. These tools enable information security or compliance teams to evaluate and manage their security processes. This helps ensure they comply with internal controls and industry or regulatory security frameworks such as SOC2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, ISO 27002, FedRAMP, NIST 800-171, NIST 800-53, and NIST Cybersecurity Framework, among others. These tools enable security and compliance analysts to assess company systems and policies and document or identify areas of compliance and noncompliance.
</p>
<p>
	Undergoing a security audit can be both time-consuming and an internal resource-intensive endeavor. This software can ensure gathering compliance information is collaborative, correct, complete, and in the format required by auditors.
</p>
<p>
	There are some similarities between security compliance software and GRC platforms, but GRC platforms focus on identifying financial, legal, and all other liabilities, not cyber security risks. There is some overlap between security compliance software and cloud compliance software, as the latter offers continuous infrastructure monitoring to identify security risks, which can be a component of automated evidence collection in security compliance software.
</p>
