    <h1>How to Install Windows</h1>
    <p>
        Each version of Microsoft Windows is installed on a computer using similar steps. While there are steps in the installation process that differ between versions of Windows, the following general steps and guidelines help you install Windows on your computer.
    </p>
    <h2>Installing or upgrading Windows</h2>
    <ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the CMOS setup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
        Change the computer's boot order. Set the CD, DVD, or disc drive as the first boot device if you are trying to boot from a disc. Or, set the first boot device to your USB drive if you're trying to boot from a USB thumb drive. If the drive is not shown, keep the disc is inserted and reboot the computer. With the disc in the drive, BIOS (basic input/output system) should recognize and include it in the list.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
        Save the settings change and exit BIOS.
    Once you have updated the boot order, you can begin the Windows installation process.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          Place the Windows disc in the CD/DVD drive or USB thumb drive into the back of the computer.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          Turn on or restart the computer. As the computer starts up, it should detect the installation disc or drive and show a message similar to Press any key to boot from CD. Press any key on the keyboard to have the computer boot from the Windows disc or drive.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          After the Windows install begins, there are several prompts that you need to answer. Select either Yes or the appropriate option to install Windows.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          When asked which partition to install Windows onto, select the main partition, usually the C: drive or one labeled "Unallocated partition". If upgrading Windows, select the existing installation of Windows on the hard drive.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          You may be asked if you want to erase all contents on the hard drive, then install Windows. We recommend you choose this option, as it also formats the hard drive to allow the Windows operating system to be installed.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          The computer may need to restart several times during the Windows install process. The restarts are normal and if prompted to restart, select the Yes option.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          When the install process is nearly complete, the Windows configuration option screens are shown. On these screens, you may be asked to select the time zone you live in, your preferred language, and the account's name you use to access Windows. Select the appropriate options and enter the appropriate information on each configuration screen.
      </p>
